This material relates to exceptional groups of order p^6.

The associated preprint is:
Exceptional groups of order $p^6$ for prime $p \geq 5$
E.A. O'Brien, Sunil Kumar Prajapati, and Ayush Udeep. 

To check outcome for individual isoclinism family, load  file Table3Phi* into magma.
The file lists the presentations for the exceptional groups from that family and
verifies that they are exceptional for a range of primes. 

Here's one example; first read in Saunders-middeg.m which defines the function Mu(G).

% magma Saunders-mindeg.m
load "Table3Phi29.m";

The file exceptional-2-3.log records SmallGroup identifers for the exceptional groups of order
dividing 2^6 and 3^6.
