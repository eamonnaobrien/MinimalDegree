Material related to exceptional groups of order p^6 
can be found in Exceptional folder.

This repository contains data and code related to the following paper:
E.A. O'Brien, Sunil Kumar Prajapati, and Ayush Udeep.
Minimal degrees for faithful permutation representations 
of groups of order $p^6$ where $p$ is an odd prime.
J. Algebraic Combin. 60, 319--388, 2024

It is designed for use with Magma.

Each directory Table-J where J \in {1,...,7} encodes data recorded in 
the corresponding table of the paper. 

The other files are:
* setup-permrep.m: Various functions needed to set up the 
associated representations for an explicit prime p. 

* Saunders-mindeg.m: An implementation in Magma of the 
algorithm of Elias et al. (2010) developed by Neil Saunders.

* Example*.m: code to realise explicit examples listed in the paper.

Here's an example of the use of the code.

% cd Table-2 
% magma Table2-Phi3.m
// For each prime p in range [5..11] 
// the groups of order p^6 in Phi3 listed in Table 1 are setup 
// and their minimal degree permutation representations are constructed. 

* The file 2-3.log reports the determination of the exceptional 2- and 3-groups 
of order p^6.  It also lists the SmallGroup library identifiers for each of these groups.
